Hi!
When you run the tests (`npm install && npm test`)  
this directory will be populated with sample API responses.  
the reason we are excluding them from GitHub is that  
they are ***tens of thousands of lines*** and change each time  
you run the tests so would pollute the repo and make PRs very "noisy" ...  
we have included *mini* sample API responses in the main readme.
